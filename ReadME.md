About Me

Hello, I'm Priss Harbuck, I'm currently a Computer Science student at Berea College. I mostly work in Python but I have experience in C++ and Java. 
I really want to work in gaming or robotics. I love playing games an I find all the aspects of creating games interesting. Building the background and forming the characters
is a really fun thing. I want to do something that makes people happy and helps form experiences which is also where robotics comes in.
